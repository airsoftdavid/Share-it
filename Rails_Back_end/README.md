# Share-it
This RCOS (CSCI 4963) project will be an Android /IOS application called Share-It that allows the sharing of contacts over Wi-Fi and airdrop. Currently, Apple doesn't offer native support for the sharing of contacts or any information to non-Apple devices and the development for this area is also lacking. Share-It allows users of the application to create "rooms" that users in the proximity can join and share details between non-compatible devices. Rooms will be created based on location data from phones and require passwords to join. This project explores the address book API's of both IOS and Android and will require basic back-end web technologies to host the "rooms". For this semester, my main goal is to familiarize myself with Apple's new developer language Swift and create an application. I create a server to host the rooms with PHP/MySQL while my partner(s) will look into the Android side of the application. Since I am unfamiliar with IOS development, my main research objective is to create an application that will be initiative to use while allowing the transfer of data with different operating systems.
